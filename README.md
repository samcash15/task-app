# task-app
This is a basic task application for users to create new tasks.

I created this application to get a better understanding of JavaFX. This app uses basic features from the Javafx library
such as FXML, HBox, Vbox, Color, and many other features such as Button, CheckBox, DatePicker, Label, ListCell, ListView, RadioButton, TextField, ToggleGroup, and Tooltip.

The Task App allows users to create new tasks and add a title, description, priority, and due date for that new task.

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the task is placed in a ListView.

When the user has completed the task, they can then check the box and the task will turn green, indicating it is completed. 
They can also click the "X" to delete the task.
